# Shopping list

The user can view all the shopping items on the home screen. The user can also add and delete items. The shop items are stored in a Firebase database so the data would not be lost if the app is deleted.

In this application I learned about the Form widget and adding a key to it to trigger validation and store the entered values. Furthermore, I learned how to post data to Firebase. Also to fetch data from Firebase and decoding the json response to use the data.
